/**
 * An abstract class that represent a generic {@link Wall} container for a certain type of {@link Wall}s,
 * where the type of the {@link WallContainerAbstract} must be specified by implementing subclasses.
 * <p>
 * {@link Wall}s in the container are sorted according to total order specified by a {@link Comparator}<{@link Wall}>,
 * where the ordering must be specified by implementing subclasses. The total ordering is done by mapping {@link Wall}s on integer numbers and
 * using the total ordering defined by the ordering in double numbers.
 * <p>
 * {@link Wall}s can be added if they are of the correct type.
 * <p>
 * The {@link WallContainerAbstract} can also return the nearest ( in the sense of the specified ordering), valid wall, where
 * validity of a {@link Wall} must be specified by implementing subclasses.
 * <p>
 * Implements the template pattern, where templates are given for the two core functionalities, i.e. adding walls
 * and obtaining a nearest wall in some sense. Subclasses must fill in the blanks by implementing the abstract methods.
 * <p>
 * Implementing classes : {@link WallContainerEast}, {@link WallContainerNorth}, {@link WallContainerSouth}, {@link WallContainerWest}
